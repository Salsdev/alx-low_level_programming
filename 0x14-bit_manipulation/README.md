# Bit Manipulation Library

## Overview

The Bit Manipulation Library is a collection of functions designed to perform various operations on binary numbers in C programming. These functions allow you to convert binary strings to unsigned integers, print binary representations, access specific bits, set or clear bits at given indices, and calculate the number of bit flips needed to transform one number into another. Whether you're working on low-level programming tasks or simply need to manipulate binary data, this library provides essential functionality for your needs.

## Functions

### 1. `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b)`

- **Prototype**: `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b)`

- **Description**: This function converts a binary number represented as a string of '0' and '1' characters to an unsigned integer. It validates the input and returns the converted number or 0 if there is an error.

### 2. `void print_binary(unsigned long int n)`

- **Prototype**: `void print_binary(unsigned long int n)`

- **Description**: This function prints the binary representation of a given number to the standard output without using arrays, malloc, %, or / operators. The format follows the example provided.

### 3. `int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index)`

- **Prototype**: `int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index)`

- **Description**: Retrieve the value of a bit at a specified index (starting from 0) in a given number. Returns the bit value or -1 if an error occurs.

### 4. `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)`

- **Prototype**: `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)`

- **Description**: Set the value of a bit at a specified index (starting from 0) in a given number to 1. Returns 1 if successful or -1 if an error occurs.

### 5. `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)`

- **Prototype**: `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)`

- **Description**: Set the value of a bit at a specified index (starting from 0) in a given number to 0. Returns 1 if successful or -1 if an error occurs.

### 6. `unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m)`

- **Prototype**: `unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m)`

- **Description**: Calculate the number of bits that need to be flipped to transform one number into another, without using % or / operators.

These functions provide essential binary manipulation capabilities and can be used in various applications where bitwise operations are required.

## Usage

To use the Bit Manipulation Library in your C project, include the appropriate header file and link with the library. Ensure that you follow the specified prototypes and guidelines for each function.
